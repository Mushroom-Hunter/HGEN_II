1. This project is written in python 3  
2. Required modules are multiprocessing, time, pandas, scipy, sklearn, matplotlib and seaborn. They should be included if you installed python with Anaconda  
3. For a quick start you can use below statements in command line to generate outputs in the working directory:  
	python main.py	# Generate text output  
	python plotting.py	# Generate plots  
4. Output files from main.py are:  
	(1) LD_D.txt, LD_Dprime.txt, LD_r2.txt  
	(2) Optional files(but needed for plotting): PCs.txt, PCA_variance_ratio_explained_by_each_PC.txt
